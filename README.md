# React Testing Dumpsterfire

This repository follows the react tutorial of creating a tick-tack-toe game, but brings in redux to emulate a larger application and react-testing-library to demonstrate how one would test an application like this. A minimum number of packages were brought in to make the demonstration as universal as possible.
